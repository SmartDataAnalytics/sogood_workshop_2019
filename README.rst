Improving Access to Science for Social Good
===========================================

This repository contains the experimental artifacts for the experiments reported in our paper entitled
"Improving Access to Science for Social Good". In particular, we uploaded the knowledge graph (KG) (data directory)
and the trained KGE models along all relevant experimental artifacts to reproduce the reported results (models).  

All models except ComplEx has been trained using the software package `PyKEEN <https://github.com/SmartDataAnalytics/PyKEEN>`_.
We will soon integrate our implementation of ComplEx to PyKEEN.
